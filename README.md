# LinearRegressionTool
Small app that I made to practice some basic knowledge of linear regression (February 2016).

The user can draw points on the screen and the app plots the curve of a polynomial that estimates the best the drawn data.<br/>
I used stdlib.jar library by Princeton University for drawing and algs4.jar library for solving a linear system with Gaussian elimination (thanks!): http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/
